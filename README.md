# Utilizing Scientific Python Tools for the Application of Data Science Techniques to High Impact Weather Prediction
My [2015 UCAR SEA Conference](https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2015/program) presentation comes in the form of an IPython 3.0 Notebook (Jupyter) divided into slide sections.
Please download the notebook as well as the associated data and code. There are lots of parameters than can be
adjusted and data to explore.

## Requirements
* Anaconda Python Distribution with these additional libraries:
    * netCDF4-python
    * basemap
    * IPython 3.0 or later

## Installation
If Git is installed on your computer, you can clone the repository with the following command:
    
`git clone https://github.com/djgagne/ucar_sea_2015.git`

Otherwise you can download the repository as a zip file by clicking on the link in the lower
right corner of the webpage.

Displaying the presentation in interactive slideshow mode requires the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) extension. See installation instructions in the RISE README file.
